    <h1>Celeste Community Difficulty Ratings</h1>
    <h2>(CCDR)</h2>
    <img src="https://ccdr.app/res/sample_extended.bmp">
    <p>Tired of map difficulty rankings that tell you nothing about whether you might actually <i>enjoy</i> a map?</p>

    <h3>Enter the CCDR</h3>
    <p>A CCDR rating is made up of 2 or 4 numbers from 1-5</p>
    <p>These numbers correspond to <b><i>Tech Complexity</i> / <i>Precision Required</i> / <i>Chocolatey-ness</i> / <i>Sight-unreadability</i></b></p>
    <p>A CCDR badge can display either tech complexity & precision:</p>

    <p>Or all 4 values:</p>

    <p>For reference, the CCDR for all vanilla A-Sides would be 1/1/1/1, where something like [map] would be [complex rating]</p>

    <h3>So, what the hell are these numbers?</h3>
    <h4>Tech Complexity</h4>
    <p>This is probably the most subjective category here. Basically, this number corresponds to the kinds of tech that need to be used. A 1 here would correspond to tech learned in vanilla A/B sides, a 2 would be vanilla C-sides/Farewell, et cetera. A 5 would mean a map makes heavy use of tech on the level of [insane tech]</p>
    <h4>Precision Required</h4>
    <p>This is basically a rating of how unforgiving the map is, where a 1 essentially corresponds to a vanilla a-side, and 5 means most things require a setup.</p>
    <h4>Chocolatey-ness</h4>
    <p>The name of this category comes from the standard phrasing of "vanilla" and "chocolate" to give a name to how many helper mods a map uses. 1 here would mean only vanilla mechanics are used, 5 would mean a significant number of mods are used. Something like Mindcrack would be a 4 or 5 on this scale.</p>
    <h4>Sight-unreadability</h4>
    <p>This was the hardest to name (dm me if you have a better name lmao), but basically this could be considered a rating of "puzzliness" -- 1 being "it's obvious what to do as soon as you see it", and 5 being "Getting through this is obscure af". A 5 here does NOT mean the actual execution is difficult, only that figuring out what to do is.</p>

    <h3>Alright, cool... now how do I use it?</h3>
    <p>For right now, the CCDR is really just this numbering scheme; Our fancy badges will be coming soon, and, in the future, I want it to be a true community rating system. It will support feedback and everything, but I'm making this as a proof-of-concept so I can see if people actually like the system</p>
    <!-- <p>The badges are pretty easy to use. Whereever you want the badge to show, just add in <span class="code">&lt;img src="https://ccdr.app/badge/[tech]/[precision]"&gt;</span> or <span class="code">&lt;img src="https://ccdr.app/badge/[tech]/[precision]/[chocolate]/[unreadability]"&gt;</span></p>
    <br>
    <p>In GameBanana you can insert an image into the request body, just paste in <span class="code">https://ccdr.app/badge/[tech]/[precision]/[chocolate]/[unreadability]</span></p>
